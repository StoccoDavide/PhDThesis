\section{Background and Motivation}

In modern engineering practices, the numerical simulation of dynamic systems has become increasingly important, offering invaluable insights into the behavior of complex systems across diverse domains. From automotive engineering to aerospace, robotics, and electrical systems, numerical simulations are indispensable for understanding system behaviors, optimizing performance, and guiding design decisions. Central to many of these simulations are systems described by \acp{ODE} and \acp{DAE}. While \acp{ODE} are relatively straightforward to solve, they have limited applicability in modeling systems with constraints or algebraic relationships~\cite{brenan1995numerical}. \acp{DAE}, on the other hand, provide a more elegant framework for modeling complex systems by combining differential equations with algebraic constraints. This versatility makes \acp{DAE} a powerful tool for modeling a wide range of dynamic systems. However, their solution poses significant challenges due to their inherent mixed differential and algebraic nature. \acp{PDE} and \acp{PDAE} are also used to model dynamic systems. The relationship between \acp{PDAE} and \acp{PDE} is analogous to the relationship between \acp{ODE} and \acp{DAE}. Unsurprisingly, the solution of \acp{PDAE} is also significantly challenging, requiring special discretization techniques to reduce the system to \acp{DAE}, for which more conventional solution methods can be employed~\cite{dedieuleveult2009global}. Nevertheless, the focus of this research is on \acp{DAE}, which are widely used in engineering applications and present distinctive challenges in terms of numerical integration and solution.

The inherent complexity and possible stiffness of \acp{DAE} pose significant obstacles to achieving fast simulations~\cite{burger2018dae, blundell2004multibody, dejalon1994kinematic}. Additionally, stiff systems, characterized by disparate timescales among variables, demand numerical methods capable of handling rapid changes without sacrificing stability or accuracy. Traditional numerical techniques, like explicit solvers, often fail in these scenarios, necessitating the adoption of implicit methods that lead to higher computational costs~\cite{petzold1982differential, brenan1995numerical}. Within this context, symbolic computation are promising for overcoming the challenges posed by \acp{DAE} in dynamic system simulation. Unlike purely numerical approaches, symbolic computation operates on mathematical expressions in their exact form. Such a capability proves valuable for lowering the structural complexities of \acp{DAE}. Indeed, symbolic techniques can systematically reduce \acp{DAE}' index, transforming them into forms more appropriate for numerical integration. This process not only unwinds the complexity of the equations but also enhances the speed and stability of numerical solvers, thereby improving the overall performance of simulations~\cite{petzold1982differential, brenan1995numerical, griepentrog1986differential}.

A key advantage of symbolic computation lies in its capacity to derive exact or partial solutions for specific components of the system. These solutions can then be leveraged to enhance the efficiency of numerical solvers by generating optimized code or simplifying the equations before numerical integration. By combining symbolic and numerical methods, researchers can exploit the strengths of each approach, thereby achieving the best performance and reliability in simulation. However, this hybrid computational framework does not come without its challenges. Such integration requires careful consideration of the algorithms, data structures, and computational strategies to ensure an optimal implementation. Indeed, symbolic operations cannot always replace numerical methods, as they may be computationally expensive or impractical for large-scale systems. Vice versa, numerical methods may struggle with overly complex symbolic expressions that could be simplified through symbolic computation, hindering the overall efficiency of the simulation. In other words, symbolic computation and numerical methods are complementary tools that carry different information and must be judiciously combined to achieve the much-desired performance improvements~\cite{cohen2002computer, cohen2003computer}. This research aims to close such a gap between symbolic computation and numerical methods, developing a comprehensive framework that leverages the strengths of both approaches to solve \acp{DAE} efficiently and accurately in dynamics simulations applied, but not limited, to vehicle dynamics.

Within the domain of vehicle simulation, the accurate and fast solution of systems described by \acp{DAE} holds paramount importance~\cite{burger2018dae,blundell2004multibody, dejalon1994kinematic, andreasson2016deployment, pankiewicz2003off}. In industries like automotive, the development of \ac{ADAS}, autonomous vehicles, and high-performance cars critically depends on robust simulations. These simulations must accurately account for the far from trivial relationships between mechanical components, control systems, and environmental factors such as driver inputs. As a consequence, vehicle dynamics simulations encounter a plethora of challenges, reflecting the complexity of real-world systems. The willingness to push the boundaries of vehicle performance, safety, and autonomous driving capabilities demands simulations that are not only accurate but also fast. This speed is crucial for \ac{RT} applications, where rapid decision-making and control are essential. Furthermore, \ac{AI} training and validation require extensive simulations. Thereby, faster simulations inherently lead to more efficient training and validation processes~\cite{piccinini2022predictive, piccinini2023physics}. Importantly, the challenges faced in vehicle dynamics simulations are not unique to this field but are representative of the broader challenges in dynamic system simulations. The need for effective simulations is a common theme across various engineering disciplines, highlighting the importance of developing advanced computational techniques.

A fast simulation does not come only from the numerical solver but also from the model's structure and the sub-models that compose it. For instance, in vehicle dynamics simulations, the tire-road interaction is a critical aspect that significantly impacts the overall performance and behavior of the vehicle~\cite{nakajima2019advanced}. The tire model's complexity and the computational cost associated with its simulation are crucial factors in determining the overall simulation speed. Another key aspect is the modeling of the vehicle's structure, which involves the simulation of flexible bodies and joints. The interaction between these components and the environment, such as the road surface, further complicates the simulation. Therefore, developing dedicated algorithms and models can significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of vehicle dynamics simulations~\cite{pankiewicz2003off}. In this regard, this research also aims to address these challenges by compounding the solutions of \acp{DAE} with tire-road interaction and vehicle structure deformation models suitable for \ac{HRT} applications.
