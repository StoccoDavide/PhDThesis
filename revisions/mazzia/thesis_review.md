 - Comment (optional): All the proposed methodology are well described, with an appropriate logical flow, the pro and contro are critically discussed.
 - Do the obtained results justify the conclusions?: 5
 - Comment (optional): The thesis was written very clearly. The results are clearly presented and justify the conclusions.
 - Are limitations to the theoretical and/or experimental approaches and/or results obtained recognized and critically discussed?: 5
 - Comment (optional): Tthe choice of the methods adopted was precisely motivated. The results obtained were analyzed in depth, highlighting merits and open questions.
 - Are the findings appropriately discussed in the context of the current literature?: 5
 - Comment (optional): The proposed methodologies have been compared to approaches from the recent literature and the obtained results have demonstrated the added value of the contributions proposed in this PhD thesis.

## Overall evaluation

 - Are the results obtained thoroughly presented and discussed in the light of the aims of the PhD project?: 5
 - Comment (optional): I believe that the research activities presented in this Ph.D. thesis are excellent both for their relevance in the application field considered and for the quality of the solutions proposed.
 - Does this thesis work represent an original and valuable contribute to the field?: 5
 - Comment (optional): The methods proposed are innovative and have been presented by analytically discussing the contributions from the theoretical point of view, and the reasons underlying the design choices made.
 - Is this thesis written in correct scientific language and style?: 5
 - Comment (optional): The Thesis text is well written. I found very few typos. The presentation is of a high-quality standard.
 - Are broader implications of the concluded research highlighted?: 5
 - Comment (optional): The Thesis addresses a relevant topic, is well-scoped, and employs sound scientific research methods. The section related to Application fields and examples is complete. Moreover all the discussed methodologies have been implemented in open source codes.
 - How would you rate this thesis in overall?: 5
 - Comment (optional): The thesis opens avenues for future research and provides the means for other researchers to evolve the state of the art. The overall evaluation is excellent.
 - Summary of the main and original results, and of positive and/or negative aspects of the thesis: The thesis discuss new symbolic-numeric schemes for the solution of DAE arising from Multibody Dynamics or Optimal Control Problems. The symbolic part is devoted to the index reduction, this make the problem to be suitable for standard solvers for Ordinary Differential Equations. Specific problems related to the symbolic calculation have been addressed deeply, like swell mitigation. Pro and Contro of the presented algorthms have been highlight. The produced code is made available open source, giving a great contribution to the community. Moreover a new tire brush model with carcass flexibility has been presented and discussed.

## Final Examination

 - Could you write a few critical questions the candidate should reply at the final defence?: Usually there is no information related to all initial conditions, which must be calculated consistently. Do you think the index reduction strategy can be used to calculate consistent initial values? Do you think these techniques could be easily generalised to boundary value problems?
 - Are you willing to partecipate in the Examination Committee?: Sì
 - Availabilty: I may ...: come to Trento in person
