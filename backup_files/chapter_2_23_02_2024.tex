\section{Introduction to Symbolic Computation}
\label{chap2:sec:introduction}

Symbolic computation, also known as computer algebra, refers to the computational manipulation of mathematical expressions in symbolic form, rather than numerical values. Unlike numerical computation, which deals with approximations and numerical solutions, symbolic computation operates on symbols representing variables, constants, and mathematical operations. This section provides an overview of symbolic computation, covering its definition, historical background, and significance in various fields.

\subsection{Definition and Scope}

Symbolic computation involves the manipulation of symbolic expressions to perform mathematical operations such as simplification, differentiation, integration, equation solving, and more. Instead of computing numerical approximations, symbolic computation aims to obtain exact or symbolic solutions in terms of algebraic expressions. This allows for precise mathematical analysis and facilitates the exploration of mathematical concepts and relationships.

The scope of symbolic computation encompasses a wide range of mathematical areas, including algebra, calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, number theory, and combinatorics. It finds applications in diverse fields such as engineering, physics, computer science, cryptography, finance, and biology.

\subsection{Historical Background}

The roots of symbolic computation can be traced back to ancient civilizations where mathematicians developed methods for solving algebraic equations and manipulating symbols. However, the formalization and mechanization of symbolic computation began in the 20th century with the advent of computers.

One of the earliest pioneers in symbolic computation was George Boole, whose work laid the foundation for symbolic logic and Boolean algebra in the mid-19th century. Later, mathematicians such as David Hilbert, Giuseppe Peano, and Bertrand Russell made significant contributions to formal logic and symbolic reasoning.

In the 20th century, the development of electronic computers enabled the implementation of symbolic computation algorithms. Early computer algebra systems (CAS) such as MACSYMA, Reduce, and Mathematica emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, revolutionizing mathematical computation.
